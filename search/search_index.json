This is achieved through the use of Optimistic Rollup technology, bolstered by a novel multi-round interactive challenge protocol. Currently, two distinct chains of Arbitrum operate on the Ethereum mainnet: Arbitrum One, which is based on Optimistic Rollup, and Arbitrum Nova, which operates under the AnyTrust principle. Both mechanisms aim to reduce dispute resolution costs on the Layer 1 (L1) chain by segmenting the fraud-proof process.</p> <p>Being Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalent, Arbitrum is built upon Geth, a highly flexible virtual machine capable of executing any Ethereum bytecode. Arbitrum also maintains a similar computation for gas costs, mirroring that of Ethereum.</p> <p>Arbitrum's architecture mandates that validators stake on a proposed new state and propose blocks, thereby adding an additional level of verification. More specifically, validators are responsible for retrieving transaction data from the sequencerInbox contract, running the transactions on a local WebAssembly Virtual Machine (WAVM), and subsequently updating the local L2 state. Following this, validators stake on the new state, propose new blocks, and enter a 7-day challenge period before finally confirming the block.</p> <p>The distinguishing characteristic of Arbitrum lies within its fraud-proof mechanism. While many systems, such as Optimism, require a comprehensive execution trace to evidence fraud, Arbitrum advocates a more fine-grained approach. The concern being that comprehensive interaction might cause the fraud proof to contain an overwhelming number of transactions and surpass the gas limit. As a solution, Arbitrum posits that a single incorrect instruction execution can initiate a fraud proof without the necessity of executing all instructions. This allows Arbitrum to break down the fraud proof into several steps, thus enabling the system to provide evidence of a sorter's misconduct, and save on costs, by merely proving that a sorter incorrectly executed a specific instruction.</p>"},{"location":"Research/Layer2/arbitrum_cancun/#12-team-background","title":"1.2 Team Background","text":"<p> The Arbitrum project is developed by Offchain Labs, a team led by experienced academics and professionals in the field of computer science.</p> <p>The co-founding team comprises Ed Felten, a former White House Deputy Chief Technology Officer and a Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University.

Camelot supports the launch of new protocols on Arbitrum, providing tools for initiating, guiding, and maintaining growth liquidity.</p> <p>2.1.2 Pendle Finance</p> <p>Pendle Finance is an innovative, permissionless DeFi yield trading protocol that enables users to manage their yields effectively. It allows users to separate and purchase the yield derived from staked ETH at a discounted rate. Pendle uniquely transforms yield tokens into standardized yield tokens (SY) and separates them into two distinct types: principal tokens (PT) and yield tokens (YT). These tokens can be traded using a custom V2 Automated Market Maker (AMM). In this system, PTs operate similarly to zero-coupon bonds, while YTs function like coupon payments, providing a unique approach to yield management in the DeFi space.</p> <p>2.1.3 Radient Finance</p> <p>Radiant Finance is a pioneering lending protocol built on the LayerZero architecture. Originating on Arbitrum, it has expanded to the BSC public chain to create a cross-chain lending protocol. This allows users to deposit on the Arbitrum public chain and borrow, and withdraw assets on other public chains such as Polygon, ETH, and BSC. Previously, such complex operations required the use of multiple lending protocols and cross-chain bridges simultaneously. Radiant Finance simplifies this process by offering a one-click solution.</p> <p>As we move towards a future with multiple coexisting chains, the problem of liquidity fragmentation across different public chains needs to be addressed. Radiant Finance solves this issue by allowing users to move freely between various public chains. This functionality sets Radiant Finance apart from mainstream lending protocols such as Aave and Compound, which do not currently offer this feature.</p> <p>2.1.4 GMX</p> <p>GMX is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) specializing in spot and perpetual contract trading, particularly on derivatives. Initially launched on the BSC chain as Gambit, GMX has since transitioned to Arbitrum and extended its support to the Avalanche (AVAX) chain. Setting itself apart from platforms like dYdX and PerpetualProtocol that utilize order book or AMM models, GMX employs a global liquidity model. This model allows users to provide liquidity not by supplying two tokens in a 1:1 ratio, such as ETH/USDT, but by directly purchasing and staking the GMX-issued liquidity token, GLP. By staking GLP, users effectively participate in GMX's market-making.</p>"},{"location":"Research/Layer2/arbitrum_cancun/#22-gamefi","title":"2.2 GameFi","text":"<p>2.2.1 Treasure Dao</p> <p>Treasure aims to create a \"Decentralized Wonderland\" composed of a series of on-chain games.

Potential Hotspot Narratives","text":"<p>3.1 Cancun Upgrade </p> <p>Major Ethereum upgrades are always noteworthy events in the Web3 space. The Shanghai upgrade in the first half of this year sparked a wave of LSD Summer. On\u00a0ACDE#163\u00a03, the scope of the Cancun upgrade was finalized.  The Cancun upgrade includes EIP 4844, EIP 1153, EIP 4788, EIP 5656, and EIP 6780(The list of included EIPs can be found in\u00a0cancun.md\u00a087), with the most notable being the capacity expansion-focused proposal, EIP-4844.</p> <p>3.1.1 Data Availability is The Critical Bottleneck for Scalability.</p> <p>In a roll-up transaction, the costs are divided into execution, storage/state, and data availability. The first two costs are incurred on the Rollup network and constitute a minor portion of the total cost. The significant bottleneck is the cost of data availability, which involves publishing data to Layer 1 (L1).</p> <p>Data availability is essential as it allows anyone to reconstruct the state without permission. The scalability provided by Layer 2 (L2) is achieved by separating execution checks and data security. This separation allows us to synchronize and obtain data to verify the state without direct influence from the sequencer.</p> <p>Currently, rollups upload data to L1 as calldata, which is expensive and inefficient. Therefore, methods such as calldata compression and EIP-4488, which reduces the cost of calldata from 16 gas to 3 gas per non-zero byte, have been introduced.</p> <p>However, using calldata is unsustainable as it brings unnecessary legacy costs to L2. The EIP-4844 proposal allows us to trim the data, as under this proposal, the data only needs to be available for a sufficient length of time for honest network participants to reconstruct the complete state and challenge the sequencer.</p> <p>3.1.2 What is EIP 4844?</p> <p>EIP-4844, also referred to as Proto-Danksharding, is a proposal aiming to lay down the groundwork for a full Danksharding specification without immediately implementing any sharding. Under this model, all validators and users are still responsible for directly verifying the availability of all data.</p> <p>Blob-Carrying Transaction: The main innovation introduced by Proto-Danksharding is a new kind of transaction, the blob-carrying transaction. Similar to a regular transaction, a blob-carrying transaction carries an additional piece of data known as a blob. These blobs are substantial in size (~125 kB) and can be more cost-effective than comparable quantities of calldata. However, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can only observe a commitment to the blob, with no access to the blob data itself.</p> <p>The Operation Process of Blob-Carrying Transaction  In this process, the Sequencer initially furnishes the data, which is then solidified on the Layer 1 (L1). Following this, the Blob sidecar is extracted from the Blob transaction, while the execution within the Blob transaction transpires within the Execution Payload. Subsequently, the necessary data for rollup state validation is relocated to a separate database. This allows Layer 2 (L2) validators to access, download, and synchronize these sidecars with L2, ensuring the seamless operation of the network.</p> <p>Two Remarkable Features of Blob-Carrying Transaction</p> <ul> <li>They are inaccessible for contract reading.</li> <li>The values contained within a Blob are set for removal by the consensus layer nodes after a one-month period. Transactions have traditionally consumed block space. However, with the advent of Layer 2 (L2), Layer 1 (L1) transitions towards acting as a data layer for L2, consequently causing Calldata to occupy more block space. The scheduled deletion of Blob data offers an effective solution to the issue of state bloat on L1.</li> </ul> <p>3.1.3 How Does Proto-Danksharding (EIP-4844) Compare to EIP-4488?</p> <p>EIP-4488\u00a0is an earlier and simpler attempt to solve the same average-case / worst-case load mismatch problem. EIP-4488 did this with two simple rules:</p> <ul> <li>Calldata gas cost reduced from 16 gas per byte to 3 gas per byte</li> <li>A limit of 1 MB per block plus an extra 300 bytes per transaction (theoretical max: ~1.4 MB)</li> </ul> <p>Proto-dank sharding is a method that creates a distinct transaction type capable of holding cheaper, large, fixed-size data blobs. There's a limit to the number of blobs per block, and these blobs are not accessible from the EVM, but only their commitments are. The consensus layer (beacon chain), not the execution layer, stores these blobs.</p> <p>The main practical difference between EIP-4488 and proto-dank sharding lies in the extent of changes they initiate. EIP-4488 seeks to minimize immediate changes, while proto-dank sharding implements more changes now to limit future modifications necessary to upgrade to full sharding.</p> <p>Though implementing full sharding is complex, even with proto-danksharding, this complexity is confined to the consensus layer. Post proto-danksharding implementation, execution layer client teams, rollup developers, and users do not need to do further work to complete the transition to full sharding. Furthermore, proto-danksharding separates blob data from calldata, making it simpler for clients to store blob data for a shorter duration.</p> <p>3.1.4 Primary Benefits of EIP-4844</p> <ul> <li>Dedicated Block Space for Data Availability</li> <li>Reduce Costs of Layer-2 Rollups</li> <li>Introduce Forward Compatibility with Full Danksharding</li> <li>Experimentation with ZK Proofs</li> </ul> <p>3.1.5 What opportunities are worth paying attention to?</p> <p>Rollup and Danksharding stand as Ethereum's sole trustless scaling solutions for the foreseeable future and perhaps indefinitely. Clearly, this will significantly benefit the entire Layer2 Rollup landscape. It's noteworthy that Arbitrum, a topic of our discussion today, also features prominently in the Layer2 landscape.</p>"},{"location":"Research/Layer2/arbitrum_cancun/#4-analysis-of-layer2-competitors","title":"4.

We further examined the subset of traders who had added most significantly to their holdings. For instance, the trader identified as 0x3737 began consistently acquiring additional $ARB tokens following a significant decline in its price. The average cost for these additional purchases is approximately $1.07. Importantly, this trader has increased their position, with no evidence of any sell-offs or profit-taking.
